User arguments: "{{args}}"
1. Interpret the first token as `scope` (e.g., `issues`, `merge_requests`, `projects`). Treat the remainder as the query string (quotes optional but recommended for multi-word queries).
2. If either scope or query is missing, ask the user to rerun the command (example: `/gitlab:search issues "runner is stuck"`).
3. Call the `gitlab.gitlab_search` tool with:
   {
     "scope": "<scope>",
     "search": "<query>"
   }
4. Summarize the top matches with titles, URLs, and relevance notes; mention if the results exceed the returned page size.
