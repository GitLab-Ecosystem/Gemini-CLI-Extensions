3. If project_id or title is missing, ask the user to rerun with the required fields.
4. Call the `gitlab.create_issue` tool with:
   {
     "project_id": "<project_id>",
     "title": "<title>",
     "description": "<description or empty string>",
     "assignee_ids": [<comma-separated IDs as integers>]  // Only if provided
   }
5. Confirm creation by echoing the new issue IID, URL, and any assigned users/labels returned.
